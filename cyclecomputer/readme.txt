Virtual Road is an app run from a web browser, for indoor bicycle riding using a trainer or running using a run pod. The app will play a video and control your bicycle resistance using the BLE FTMS protocol if you are using a smart trainer. If you only have a power meter you can connect it instead of a trainer and you can connect a run pod for running on a treadmill. It will display current speed, distance, watts and elapsed time as well as averages and play a video at the speed that you are riding. The app will also connect to a BLE enabled Heart Rate Monitor and display current and average heart rate and a Cadence sensor to disiplay current and average cadence. VRoad has been tested on the Chrome web browser.

In order to use the app you will need both a GPX file and synchronized Video of the same route. You can create your own or download some from the internet. If you create your own the GPX file needs to begin and end at the same point as the video. If you need to edit the GPX file you can use GPXMagic or GPXStudio. Some routes ready to use can be found at https://cycling.vangestel.online/indoor/videos/. You can also find some videos with GPX files on youtube. 

To do a ride first select the video you want to use by clicking on the Video button. You can start anywhere on the route by entering the distance in miles in the text area next to the Start button. You must enter the starting location before connecting the trainer. Then select the type of device to connect from the Connect Device drop down list, and then click on it to connect to the device. A smart trainer , heart rate monitor and cadence sensor or run pod can be used. Once your devices are connected begin pedalling and then press the Start button to begin. The video will pause when the speed goes below the Pause speed parameter which defaults to 1 mph. When you are finished press the stop button and then click on Save GPS to save a GPX file to a folder that you select. Also click on Save Data to save the data to a file in a folder that you select. You can upload your ride to STRAVA by sending an email to stravaupload@gotoes.org after setting up your email at https://gotoes.org/strava/index.php. Click on the Email to Strava button on the main page and attach the GPX file from the folder you previously saved it to. You can always upload the file manually using the Strava website.

Workouts using the zwo format and extension can be used. You can select the workout using the Workout button. Y
